behance-api-template
====================

A simple template that uses the Behance API to pull in your portfolio.

There are examples included here. One is "index.html" which creates a list of projects for a particular user in the left sidebar. Clicking on the items in this list loads the project module in the content area on the left.

The second example is a bit more complex. It uses bootstrap to create a responsive Behance template. It loads thumbnail images of each project. Clicking on a thumbnail loads the project into a modal window.
