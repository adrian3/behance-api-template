Behance API Template
====================

A simple template that uses the Behance API to pull in your portfolio.

There are examples included here. One is "index.html" which creates a list of projects for a particular user in the left sidebar. Clicking on the items in this list loads the project module in the content area on the left.

The second example is a bit more complex and can be found in the file called "index-bootstrap.html". It uses bootstrap to create a responsive Behance template. It loads thumbnail images of each project. Clicking on a thumbnail loads the project into a modal window. 

To use, be sure to add your Behance API key in the first line of the behance.js file. To get your key you will have to register your app with Behance. More info about Behance's API can be found here: [http://www.behance.net/dev](http://www.behance.net/dev)
